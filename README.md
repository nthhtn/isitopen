Is It Open?

Description of the webapp is here: https://gist.github.com/seahyc/d013a8f8f1c1be52513cf7b77cce6e81

You're free to pick your database and backend language, but we'd prefer you use React and Redux on the frontend. If youâ€™re a frontend developer with no backend background, Firebase is always an option, but a more suitable stack will definitely earn you bonus points.

This is the raw data for restaurant opening hours - (https://gist.githubusercontent.com/seahyc/7ee4da8a3fb75a13739bdf5549172b1f/raw/f1c3084250b1cb263198e433ae36ba8d7a0d9ea9/hours.csv). Treat it as a raw data source that you can extract, transform and load into your database.

Build a simple user-facing webapp that allows the user to filter for restaurants open by date time as well as restaurant name. On top of that, users can save restaurants into their own named collections (eg. Vegetarian favourites, Meat-lovers etc.).

Bonus
This is optional, it just serves as an additional proof point. Even if you submit without these features, we will consider the submission complete.

Users can also invite their friends to collaborate (add, remove, edit name) on the collections via email, and they can see updates to their collections in real-time, without page refreshes.

Deployment
It'd be great if you can deploy this on the free tier of any cloud hosting platform (eg. free dyno on Heroku), so that we can easily access the application via an url.
